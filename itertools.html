<h2>Itertools</h2>
  <p>
    The additional python module that we wanted to integrate into our project is called Itertools. Essentially, as the name implies, it is used to iterate over data structures called ‘iteratables’ using for-loops. This module is used mainly for efficiency and to elevate the readability of the code. There are two subtypes of itertools, infinite and finite. Infinite iterators run forever unless it is coded to stop otherwise, while finite iterators can come to a stop. The two that we wanted to incorporate were chain and combinations. The combination () function returns x length that we would input as all the possible combinations of the string. Permutation in Itertools is a tool that returns a sequential ‘x’ length permutations of the elements within the iterable. If the ‘x’ value is not defined, or there is none, then the program automatically defaults to the length of the iterable itself, and all of the possible full length permutations are generated. Permutations are printed in sorted lexical order. Lexical order is most commonly seen in dictionaries where the list is sorted alphabetically and the symbols follow a specified sequence. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the unchangeable elements that are being recombined will create a sorted order. We used Itertools to get the powerset of an input, as it would require other elements of python we have not gone over to execute from scratch otherwise.
