      <p> Packaging is equally as important as promoting and creating listings to creating a successful etsy start-up. Think of packaging as a form of promoting your products offline. It is a demonstration of both quality and care you take with the products and customers so that it goes above and beyond standards. It leaves a lasting impression of your brand on the customer and increses the likelihood of them purchasing from you again on future occasions. The packaging your products should ultimately reflect on your brand and the impression you'd like consumers to have of it. For example, using eco-friendly and minimalistic stationery sugests that the brand focuses on organic living and sustainability. Some things one can consider including are stickers, business cards, or and goodies that correspond with the order. Here is a link that goes in depth on the importance and lasting impression of packaging :)
