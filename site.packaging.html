<h2>picture perfect packaging</h2>
 <p> Packaging is equally as important as promoting and creating listings for having a successful etsy start-up. Think of packaging as a form of promoting your products offline. It is a demonstration of both quality and care you take with the products and customers so that it goes above and beyond standards. It leaves a lasting impression of your brand on the customer and increases the likelihood of them purchasing from you again on future occasions. The packaging your products should ultimately reflect on your brand and the impression you'd like consumers to have of it. For example, using eco-friendly and minimalistic stationery suggests that the brand focuses on organic living and sustainability. Some things one can consider including are stickers, business cards, or goodies that correspond with the order.

<h3>here are some elements you can customize when packaging:</h3>
 <p>Box: white or brown corrugated boxes are the way to go. They are universal and options are endless. Additionally, they are typically the most affordable and the sturdiest. 
 <br>Tissue Paper: Wrapping your products in tissue paper adds an extra level of protection and anticipation for the unboxing experience. Colored tissue paper is a good option to go with, but if you want to go the extra mile, you can custom print your shop name onto the paper itself to make it memorable. 
 <br>Stuffing: There are many ways to fill in the empty crevices and spaces in your box such as by using styrofoam packing peanuts, foam, air pillows, bubble wrap, or even crinkle paper. You may want to opt for packing peanuts or the crinkle paper as they fall more toward the visually appealing end.  
 <br>Sticker: stickers are a super fun and versatile packaging goodie! For instance, if you used tissue paper, you can use a logo sticker to seal it together or you can add some fun and cool looking stickers that match your brand's aesthetic as a treat. The possibilities are endless and you can buy it in bunches at an affordable price. 
 <br>Promotional Card: This is an inexpensive way of adding branded promotional items to your package. To paint a picture, you can add a card that gives the customer a promo code to use on their next order or even one that they encourage telling a friend about the store, this is known as “mouth marketing”. 
 <br>Custom Note: Handwritten note to customers adds a personal touch to the packaging that big corporations don’t do. It makes the connection between the seller and recipient deeper and adds realness. A great way to personalize the note is by writing the name the note is directed to:)
