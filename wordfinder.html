<h2>Using Scrabble Word Finder</h2>
  <p>
    The function Scrabble Word Finder puts all the skills you need for Scrabble together to help guide you through the game. It combines Scrabble Dictionary and the subset function to give you a list of words you can use in the game. All you do is input however many letters you like as a string, and the coding does the work for you! The letters are formed into subsets using the subset function, and the subsets are checked to see if they are considered real words using the Scrabble dictionary file, which is encoded into the code. The file has all the words A-Z that are allowed for points in a real Scrabble game. After the real words are confirmed, the point counting function (Using Scrabble Dictionary) is used to find the point values of every subset. The function returns every word along with its point value. Use this function to see all the possibilities of words you can make given the Scrabble tiles you have, as well as finding the words with the greatest point value, all with one function!
