<h2>promote like a pro</h2>
 <p> There are many effective ways to promote small businesses and start-ups on etsy. The most obvious way which also targets a large amount of people at the same time is social media platforms. Creating business accounts on popularized apps such as Tiktok, Instagram, and Facebook are great ways to encourage merchandise. The etsy platform also favors and boosts your business if you are active. These apps also have setting specifications that can have these ads pop up on the age group that the product targets. For instance, I sell customizable Starbucks goods and analytics show that people who order from me are typically female between 17-28 years old. Based on this data, I can customize which areas and age groups to target. Social media is definitely the way to go for promoting nowadays, especially with remote work and school!

<h3>these are some ways you can promote on social media:</h3>
 <p>Tiktok: by setting up a business account dedicated solely to your shop, you can post 15-60 second entertainment videos that revolve around your business. On tiktok, there are new trends that are being made every single day and by putting creative twists onto them using your products as props, are a great way to bring attention to your website! You can also make informational videos about them and use hashtags to help you reach your target audience. It is a fun and easy way to gain business!
 <br>Facebook: there are many ways to advertise and promote on facebook. For one, you can join facebook groups with people interested in the broad spectrum of what you are trying to sell. For instance, if you sell handmade beaded rings, you can join many jewelry based facebook groups  to help spread the word. Additionally, you can create a business page on facebook that allows you to customize your goals and audience and then you can share the posts to the desired audience, which will gain more views as more people interact with it.
 <br>Instagram: Like facebook and tiktok, you can create a business instagram account that allows you to promote your business to wherever you desire and for however long you choose. While, there is a fee to spread the word and share your posts on the others feeds, you will gain likes and shares that are beneficial to your account and shop.
 <br>Etsy: Etsy takes account of sellers who are on top of their shops. Sellers who tend to be more active and add more to what they already have out, get more clicks. What I mean by active is when a business uploads new listings and updates their profiles on a regular basis, etsy takes note of it and makes their listings appear higher up on search results. As consumers, we tend to choose on listings that fit what we are looking for and are towards the top of the page. The higher your listing is as a search, the more interaction you will get. This is a win-win, since you create more content, your outreach increases and you are rewarded by being boosted into higher ranks of the listings.
