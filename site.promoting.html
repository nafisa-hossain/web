    <p> There are many effective ways to promote small businesses and start-ups on etsy. The most obvious way which also targets a large amount of people at the same time is social media platforms. Creating business accounts on popularized apps such as Tiktok, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are great ways to encourge merchandise. These apps also have setting specifications that can have these ads pop up on the age group that the product targets. For instance, I sell customizable starbucks goods and analytics show that people who order from me are typically female between 17-28 years old. Based on this data, I can customize which areas and age groups to target. The etsy platform also favors and boosts your business if you are active. What I mean by active is when a business uploads new listings and updates their profiles on a regular basis, etsy takes note of it and makes their listing appear higher up on search results. Here is a helpful link on how to promote using ads on Instagram :)
