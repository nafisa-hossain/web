     <h2>how to create compelling listings</h2>
      <p> Listings are directly related to selling products. That is why product photography using the SEO strategy is essential. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. By using good photos, it increases the chances of a potential buyer clicking on your listing, SEO is how you get found in search results. However, it won't matter if you show up on top of the page unless you have appeasing photos that attract Etsy shoppers to click. There are many things you can do to take nice product photos.
      </p>
      <h3>here are some useful tips:</h3>
      <p>
      Use minimalistic backgrounds: a solid/simple background that doesn't clash or take attention away from the product you are trying to sell helps to draw focus on your item while adding a clean look. 
      <br>Have a cohesive profile: this makes your brand look organized, professional, and sets a foundation of style. It gives off the impression that you are organized and have set style for your shop, otherwise it may look chaotic and all over the place.
      <br>Natural lighting is the best lighting: take your photos in well lit areas or even outside during the day. This makes the product itself look more pleasing and eye-catching!
      <br>Edit: make finetune edits to fix up some harsh areas. DO NOT OVERDO IT! Overediting is unappealing and definitely noticeable. It sets unrealistic expectations for the buyer and takes away from the itemâ€™s natural beauty.
      <br>For example, take a look at some of my listings:
      </p>
     <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/23991920/r/il/def00d/2460269445/il_570xN.2460269445_j8cq.jpg" width="175" height="200">
      <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/23991920/r/il/f91343/2460526967/il_570xN.2460526967_rdrf.jpg" width="175" height="200">
      <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/23991920/r/il/60fa3c/2412918224/il_570xN.2412918224_1pfw.jpg" width="175" height="200">
      <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/23991920/r/il/f95e09/2412780378/il_570xN.2412780378_ihou.jpg" width="175" height="200">
      <p> Notice, how all product photos are taken during daylight and with a leafy backdrop
      <br>This is the logo and banner for my shop:
    </p>
      <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/isla/e6cc7b/42627681/isla_500x500.42627681_cwe3ry06.jpg" width="150" height="150">
    <br>
      <img src="https://i.etsystatic.com/isbl/353072/41697074/isbl_1680x420.41697074_dmp863op.jpg" width="750" height="150">
    <p>This follows tip#2 as it uses the same color palette which makes it look cohesive along with images which adds additional information as to what my store is about. <br>
Be sure to be very specific with the details in the description, and use a mixture of descriptive and general terms in the title of your product for optimal number of searches.
