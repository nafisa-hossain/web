    <p>Last summer I started a small business using the etsy platform. One day, during Mid-July of 2020, I was scrolling through Tiktok as per usual and notice so many people have started their own small businesses.  Whether it was jewelry, make-up, artwork, or clothes that they were selling. I saw these kinds of videos pop up on my feed and decided to use that as a sign to start one. My thought process when making this decision was, "it's not like I have anything better to do, and it would be easy money." It seemed perfect because I was going to look for a summer job, but since this wasn't likely, this business would be the next best thing. A few days after I had the idea, I was browsing for a gift to buy for a friend's birthday and came across a custom Starbucks cup that would be perfect for them. However, as I stared at the price of the cup itself plus its shipping and tax, I had a light go on in my head that said I could make it myself. That is what I decided to end up selling. I was going to sell customizable Starbucks cups. I had no idea what was ahead of me when I decided that I wanted to do this. I had to figure out shipping methods, cup and straw carriers, packaging, box supply, promoting products, and customization supplies. I had used up all the money I had saved up over the last couple of years and some more as an investment. My friends and family promoted it on their socials to bring in customers. Over the summer, I had over 50 orders and sold over 75 cups. That may not seem like a lot, but it's more than I ever planned on making that summer. Fast forward to this December (aka Holiday season); I had orders rolling in. I received over 75 orders in the first week of December. I self-taught myself all that I know about this sorta thing and have picked up some tips and tricks that companies use to bring in buyers after going through business rut myself. Since then, I have learned a lot about business management and administration.</p>
