    <h1>etsy marketing!</h1>
    <p>Last summer I started a small business using the etsy platform. Since then, I have learned a lot about business management and administration.
    <h2>promoting</h2>
    <p> There are many effective ways to promote small businesses and start-ups on etsy. The most obvious way which also targets a large amount of people at the same time is social media platforms. Creating business accounts on popularized apps such as Tiktok, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are great ways to encourge merchandise. These apps also have setting specifications that can have these ads pop up on the age group that the product targets. For instance, I sell customizable starbucks goods and analytics show that people who order from me are typically female between 17-28 years old. Based on this data, I can customize which areas and age groups to target. The etsy platform also favors and boosts your business if you are active. What I mean by active is when a business uploads new listings and updates their profiles on a regular basis, etsy takes note of it and makes their listing appear higher up on search results.

    <h3>listings</h3>
    <p> Listings are directly related to selling products. That is why product photography using the SEO strategy is essential. SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. By using good photos, it increases the chances of a potential buyer clicking on your listing, SEO is how you get found in search results. However, it wont matter if you show up on top of the page unless you have appeasing photos that attract Etsy shoppers to click. There are many things you can do to take nice product photos. Here are some tips: use minimalistic backgrounds that doesn't clash or take attention away from the product you are trying to sell, have a cohesive profile (this makes your brand look organized, professional, and sets a foundation of style), natural lighting is the best lighting, make finetune edits to present a clean look, use very specific details in the description. Additionally it is helpful to use a mixture of descriptive and general terms in the title of your product for optimal number of searches.

    <h4>packaging</h4>
    <p> Packaging is equally as important as promoting and creating listings to creating a successful etsy start-up. Think of packaging as a form of promoting your products offline. It is a demonstration of both quality and care you take with the products and customers so that it goes above and beyond standards. It leaves a lasting impression of your brand on the customer and increses the likelihood of them purchasing from you again on future occasions. The packaging your products should ultimately reflect on your brand and the impression you'd like consumers to have of it. For example, using eco-friendly and minimalistic stationery sugests that the brand focuses on organic living and sustainability. Some things one can consider including are stickers, business cards, or and goodies that correspond with the order.
